# Fachwerk: Your AI agents, one click away

## See your Claude Code agents and skills without leaving your editor.

---

**The Problem:**

You're building AI agents. Tweaking them. Iterating. But every time you want to check or edit one, you have to remember the path, open a terminal, navigate to `~/.claude/`. Switch context. Lose flow.

VS Code has no "global pinned folders." Your agents live in a hidden directory. Out of sight, out of mind.

You treat your agents like employees. You should be able to see them.

**The Solution:**

Fachwerk puts your Claude Code agents and skills in the VS Code sidebar. Always there. Any project. One click to open, edit, or create.

No setup per workspace. No remembering paths. The skeleton of your AI workflow, visible.

**Quote:**

"Your agents are the framework of how you work with AI. They shouldn't be hidden in a dot directory."

**What developers are saying:**

"I iterate on my agents constantly. Having them in the sidebar changed how I work. I actually improve them now instead of forgetting they exist."

**About the name:**

Fachwerk is German for timber-frame construction. The exposed wooden beams of traditional European buildings. Structure as aesthetic. The skeleton visible, honest, functional.

Your Claude Code config is the skeleton of your AI workflow. Fachwerk makes it visible.
